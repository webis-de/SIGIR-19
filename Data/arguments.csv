0001,00008865,00000001,True,Pro,3,4,2,3,Abortion should be legal,"Abortion should be legal because if a woman doesn't want to have a child than she should have the right to prevent herself from having one. If the government bans abortion then they would be forcing a woman to have a child. If a pregnant woman doesn't have an abortion then she is going to have a child. So if the government takes away that right then pregnant women will have no choice but to have a child. Adoption is a option that is not used often after a woman gives birth to a child. Most women don't want to put their child up for adoption. If the government bans abortion then some women will have an unsafe abortion. More women will have an unsafe abortion if abortion is illegal. Every year approximately 78,000 women die from unsafe abortion. If abortion is legal then less unsafe abortions will occur. Abortion is a safe medical procedure. 88% of women who have an abortion do so in their first trimester. Medical abortions have less than 0.5% risk of serious complications and do not affect a woman's health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth. The government should make sure that late term abortion is safe. The fetus is in the woman's body so therefore the government should not control their bodies. Banning abortion is bad for women and is anti-women's rights.",repetitive

0001,00011158,00000005,True,Con,3,2,3,3,Why Abortion should be banned,"What about the trauma rape victims go through? Rape victims often get PTSD from their ordeal. Being pregnant and knowing you MUST deliver a baby you had no consent in making puts a lot of stress on the rape victim. It adds to the trauma. Rape is not a good thing, even if a baby comes out of it. Another thing is that women aren't entirely helpless. They take precautions. Some are black belts and others carry pepper spray or a gun. And why should we penalize women for being the victim? Another thing is that banning abortion will not stop it, just like how the Prohibition Act did not stop alcohol. The only thing an abortion ban will stop is safe abortions. Women who do not want a baby will still try it on themselves, without the help of a doctor. And trying abortion without a doctor is extremely risky. This could not just kill the baby, but it's dangerous to the woman as well. It could end up killing them both, or even worse, keeping the baby alive, but horribly deform it.",
0001,00012801,00000010,True,Not specified,3,4,4,4,There are practical problems with banning abortion,"Not only is banning abortion a problem in theory, offending against a woman's right to choose, it is also a practical problem. Enforcing an abortion ban would require a quite degrading and inhumane treatment of those women who wished to have their fetus terminated. Moreover, if pregnant women traveled abroad, they would be able to have an abortion in a country where it was legal. Either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement, or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it. The middle way of tacitly accepting foreign terminations would render hypocritical the much-vaunted belief in the sanctity of life. The demand for abortions will always exist; making abortion illegal, will simply drive it underground and into conditions where the health and safety of the woman might be put at risk.1 Example: Polish women, living in a country with extremely restrictive abortion laws often go abroad to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria for abortions.2 Women who are not lucky enough to live in environments such as the EU may be forced to go to foreign countries and undergo underground, unsafe abortions. 1 WARSAW BUSINNES JOURNAL",
0001,00015397,00000001,True,Pro,3,3,2,4,There should not be any type of ban on Abortion,"First of all, I'd like to welcome dxpilot to this debate. I would first like to state that, there are many reasons there should not be a ban on abortion. First of all, it is the mother's choice, and the mother's choice alone. Simple as that. Post-abortion guilt. These effects do not always take place. Suppose a woman got raped, and she was worried about the child she was to have. She could, very easily, feel relief in getting an abortion, knowing that there will not be any other long-term effects. Although this seems a bit immoral, I do not think a growing fetus should be considered a human. Just like an apple seed should not be considered an apple tree. And although this seems just as immoral, it is not an independet creature. It lives much like a parisite, living off of it's host. Some may say that, when a pregnant mother is killed, it is counted as double murder. And because of this, there should be a ban, right? Wrong. It has often been proven that medical laws and procedures, can very much differ from the laws upheld in the courtroom. Prove me wrong.",

Opinion...,"These opinion polls are misleading, as they force respondents to choose between an outright ban or no control at all – it is impossible for them to register support for partial-birth abortion in cases where the mother’s physical or psychological health is in danger. A majority of Americans are still in favour of the right to abortion. More importantly, this should not be the business of the general public or of legislators. Nobody who would prefer not to have a partial-birth abortion will be made to have one. Most people who want it banned will never face a situation where it directly affects them in any case. We should leave decisions up to the people who are directly affected by them - not to outsiders, who are free to express their opinion but not to impose it on everyone else.

Furthermore, in 1997 the House of Representatives voted 295-136, and the Senate 64-36, in favour of a ban.

0001,00029931,00000001,True,Pro,4,3,3,4,Abortion Should Be Banned in America,"True, the freedoms granted to us in the constitution are many. However, nowhere in the constitution is any provision made for any abortion. While there are indeed certain clauses that seemingly would allow them in principle, I see no place where it is stated, mainly because it was never an issue in the time of the founding of the US. Furthermore, My opponent has generalized those who will receive an abortion as those “who are either not ready or too poor to support a child.” While this summarizes some of those who will receive an abortion, this certainly cannot be true of all or even a majority of those who will receive an abortion. Then, my opponent uses an appeal to pity and asks the question “Would you like to be unwanted? Dirt poor? Malnourished?” As if the choice to ban abortion will lead to a bunch of poor malnourished children lying in the streets with cardboard signs saying “feed me” My opponent then states that if we ban abortion, the immediate result is children dying and suffering in this world. While this may be true for some cases, this is by no means a general rule. It also is a slippery slope, that if we do this one thing, this exact thing will happen to everyone, therefore, the first thing should not happen. While I did feel pity for those who my opponent described, I have found little logical basis for deciding that outlawing abortion would be wrong. Thanks! : )",

Climate change is a problem that transcends all human made boudaries and lays hand on all aspects of society. When addressing climate change, a country has to do so from many angles - the economic sector, the power sector, the environmental section, etc. etc. In most countries, ministries already exist for these sectors, and while making decisions on climate change, it would be very confusing to decide which ministry makes which decision. For example, when deciding on renewable energy - a policy to reduce carbon emmissions, the question arises who will oversee this - the energy/electricity ministry, or the climate change ministry. When allocating funds for climate change prevention and mitigation, the question arises - who will oversee this - the economic ministry or the climate change ministry. Climate change is a central problem that has to be addressed from all sides. THere are already relevant ministries on all sides that can take this action. A climate change ministry would simply make the other ministries inefficient in taking action, while not being able to be efficient itself. While a ministry like this may look like a harbinger for change, it would only lead to inter-governmental confusion and cause the ministers and ministries to trip over each other's works and in the end make climate action even more difficult than it already is.",
0002,00026112,00000001,True,Pro,1,2,2,3,The best method to determine whether or not man made climate change is true is reduction of Co2.,"Full topic: The best method to determine whether or not man made climate change is true or false is to dramatically reduce man made levels of Co2. We need to take drastic measures to reduce man made Co2 levels ASAP. I've become convinced of this due to the climate change deniers. Simply, put the climate change deniers are correct, there is not enough evidence. Therefore, we need to accumulate more evidence via experimentation. Thus far all we have done is endlessly discuss if climate change is real or false and collecting observation evidence. Empirical evidence is split into two grounds. A. Observation evidence B. Scientific experiments All I've seen is A, thus far. We need B, and we need to know soon. The only way I can imagine to test this theory of global climate change is via experimentation. We must take control and change a variable. I vote Co2 is the best variable. Now as Co2 as the variable we have two choices, to raise or lower Co2 levels. Considering it would be immoral to raise Co2 levels given the observation evidence, we can only lower Co2 levels. Since a small decrease in Co2 levels would be more difficult to determine, a large decrease in amount of Co2 produced by man made sources is the only solution. That way if climate change is caused by a confounding factor we will have a better chance of acknowledging that confounding factor and taking corrective actions. To recap, we need more evidence for whether or not climate change is true in the form of experimental evidence. Lowering man-made Co2 dramatically is the best and only moral option.

Also burden of proof will be 51% on my opponent and 49% on me. Manmade global climate change is the general increase in temperature at rapid rates that is mainly caused by CO2 from industry increases. Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. [0] Although 1.4 degrees doesn't sound much, it ends up being a lot. This is because not all areas of the world heat at the same rate and such a rapid change is hard to adapt to. There is no signs of relief from climate change. My opponent will attempt to deny climate change, but please remember how long the cigarette companies held out despite the science being heavily against them. Now we know as sure as the sun rises that cigarettes cause cancer. I can honestly state that as sure as the sun rises, global climate change is upon us and is a threat. Al Gore's inconvenient truth is still a master piece, and I will not accept defeat until my opponent can defeat the documentary. [1] Not watching Al Gore's documentary is no excuse.

Because when Muslims are deported from the USA, they will begin to develop a hatred towards America, just like ISIS. Afterwards, ISIS will be able to recruit more members because there will be a greater hatred towards the USA. Not only that, but Donald Trump will ruin relations with Mexico when he builds the wall, Mexico will therefore stop trading with the USA and the US will need to get cheap labor from somewhere, right? So, they turn to China and other countries like India and Indonesia to manufacture their goods. Donald Trump will not bring more jobs to the USA, he has already been exposed of outsourcing jobs for his company to China and India. Also, Donald Trump will abolish the IRS and introduce a flat tax rate, which benefits the rich and has a negative effect on the poor. This will only increase the debt, and increase the unemployment rate. Everyone hates Trump, even the President dislikes him, this will hit him hard when the voting process begins, everyone will be against Trump, and Hillary will only gain more support because all of Trump's haters will vote for Hillary increasing her chances of becoming president.

The first reason Trump would make a good president is the fact that he will be more strict on immigrants. Building a wall is a smart idea because even though people cross over our borders illegally, we still allow some of them to reside here. This is wrong because the U.S. government is rewarding them for breaking laws. When Trump builds a border fence, this will stop because the immigrants will have to cross over legally and the bad ones will be filtered out easily. The second reason Donald Trump would make a good president is his stance on terrorism. ISIS does horrible things and they must be stopped. A temporary restriction on Muslims entering the country is a good idea because, lets face facts, most terrorists are Muslims. If we put a restriction on Muslim's entering the country, it will be much easier to fight against ISIS without having terrorists in our country. Finally, Trump would make a good leader because of his experience with economics. Donald Trump already owns a mufti billion dollar company meaning he has experience with economic crisis's and money management. The debt has gone up 7.7 trillion dollars under Obama's rule. ( and having an experienced business man in office is a good idea. These reasons listed above and many others are why Donald trump would make a good president.",

Yet this makes zero sense as a condemnation of gay marriage; it's not like gay people would be having kids if gay marriage was ILLegal. In fact, gay marriage can help alleviate the problem of heterosexual marriages that don't work and leave children in the foster home system, since gay couples adopt much more regularly and tend to be better parents than heterosexual couples (2).

One reason for being against gay marriage is that it offends God.In the bible,Angels were sent to destroy the city of Sodom and Gomorrah because of its wickedness.What were the examples of this great wickedness?Gay marriage is among them and this was what made the angels more angry.The question is do you get angry at good things?No,of course{Gen.19:24-25}.

Also,gay marriage violates procreation.Jesus Christ did not come into the world through a man.He came through a woman because women are supposed to give birth not males.Gay marriage does not bring about procreation.Instead,it brings about the so-called pleasure.Albert Einstein is not a product of gay marriage.Shakespeare is not,Aristotle is not and so many great men.

This also meant that gay couples who are recognized as being married in there respective states would not receive the same federal benefits that heterosexual couples do. 2) The Deference of Marriage Act also established that no state, territory or Indian tribe would be required to give effect to gay relationships that may be considered a marriage in another state, territory or Indian tribe. As it stands today there are only 5 states that recognize and perform gay marriages, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. This would mean that gay marriage in considered illegal in 90% of the states. --------------------------------------------- Conclusion: Seeing as gay marriage is illegal on the Federal level and illegal in 90% of the states it is only rational to consider homosexual marriage illegal in the United States.

First, there are more guns available legally and illegally, thus there is more gun violence. Second, having a gun does very little to protect you against a pre-meditated crime. If a criminal sneaks up behind you, you will not have time to draw your weapon. Third, having a gun emboldens some criminals and makes some crimes easier - such as robbing stores.

The issue mentioned in the title is key to the reason why so much negative public perception is directed at guns, and thus why many people shudder at the thought of unrestricted gun ownership. The position I am taking is that the media, while not always intentionally, has shown a clear bias in reporting stories that convey the negatives of gun usage and ownership. Simultaneously, they have failed to give the same treatment towards the stories which exhibit the positives of everyday citizens using guns. My opponent should be of the position that the media fairly covers both the positive and negative occurrences of gun usage, with no inherent bias towards either side.

But correlation is not causation, just because I can find a place where guns are illegal that has a lower crime rate than one where they are legal doesn’t prove anything because hat nation where guns are illegal might otherwise have a lower crime rate.

So what has the introduction of universal coverage brought the French? Costs and waiting lists. France’s system of single-payer health coverage goes like this: the taxpayers fund a state insurer called Assurance Maladie, so that even patients who cannot afford treatment can get it. Now although, at face value, France spends less on healthcare and achieves better public health metrics (such as infant mortality), it has a big problem. The state insurer has been deep in debt since 1989, which has now reached 15 billion euros.[1] Another major problem with universal health care efficiency is waiting lists. In 2006 in Britain it was reported that almost a million Britons were waiting for admission to hospitals for procedures. In Sweden the lists for heart surgery are 25 weeks long and hip replacements take a year. Very telling is a ruling by the Canadian Supreme Court, another champion of universal health care: “access to a waiting list is not access to health care”.[2] Universal health coverage does sound nice in theory, but the dual cancers of costs and waiting lists make it a subpar option when looking for a solution to offer Americans efficient, affordable and accessible health care.

I still believe that you have the burden of proof because you need to show me why God does, or probably does exist. By stating that I have the burden of proof is essentially asking me to prove non-existance. I can't really prove that unicorns, fairies, dragons (the giant fire-breathing ones), and minotaurs don't exist, so why should I be the one proving that God exists? Therefore, in a debate I feel that it would make more sense for the proponent of God to attempt to prove His existance than asking a non-believer to prove he doesn't exist. Also, I specifically stated it in the rules. My definition of God is what I wanted Con to prove existed. I was arguing that 'The creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority' probably doesn't have actual being. 1. God is the creator and ruler of the universe, and source of all moral authority (pro's definition) 2. God exists if it has actual being (pro's definition) 3. It is impossible to be the creator and ruler of the universe, and source of all moral authority, yet not exist 4. Therefore God must exist 1.

One can show many scientific evidence, theory etc for claiming that God doesn't exists as well as God does exist. But none of them completely proves either of it. The existence of God is a belief rather than an established truth. This belief comes inherently on a human being from parents/societies belief. Then as time goes by people acquires knowledge, experience that helps them to set a belief of their own. Now, the intelligence of people differs from person to person and each individuals perception on the existence of God would obviously vary depending on the people surrounding him/her, religion, society he/she raised in. I, personally, believe in God. I'm an admirer of science but still now I haven't found any scientific theory or proof that completely eliminates the existence of God. One of the most prominent theory of Science, ""The Big Bang Theory"", the non believer in God most of the time mentions to prove non existence of God can't satisfy most of the believer of God. The argument still remains about what caused the Big Bang initially. There must have been something or someone that caused the big bang. If we assume that God created the Big Bang, let it flow in it's own pace following some set of rules and then sometimes intervenes to keep the universe in order, the whole thing adds up.

Legal experts and statisticians from Michigan and Pennsylvania used the latest techniques to produce a PEER REVIEWED (that is very important for validity) study that showed that at least 4.1% of people who were given the death penalty since the 1970's were later proven as well as anything can be proven to be innocent. This is an impressive figure, because what this shows that, if the point of the death penalty is retribution for families of victims of murder, the death penalty is counter productive when people innocent of that crime are executed. Keep in mind, if you are pro death penalty you are accepting that some people who were innocent will slip through the cracks. Article: Study the article was based on: On top of the counter productivity, I have heard the argument that the death penalty actually costs less than a life sentence, but this is false on every front. 1) Until some one is finally executed the regular prison price is being paid while they are on death row, meaning a death penalty does not get rid of the prison cost. 2)It costs $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 in tax revenue for each death penalty case for trials and appeals, while for an entire 40 years in prison it costs $1,000,000-$1,250,000.

Executing criminals is not worth it if the cost of doing so is radically more than simply confining them for life and the chance of mistakenly executing an innocent. DNA evidence has already proven some thought to be criminals as innocent. New inventions in technology may also free innocents as DNA technology has, but If they have already been executed it is too late for them to freed. The small deterrence effect of the death penalty is nowhere near effective enough to justify the financial cost of the death penalty in the United States nor the possibility of executing innocent civilians. Report of the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice (2008) ""Using conservative rough projections, the Commission estimates the annual costs of the present (death penalty) system to be $137 million per year. The cost of the present system with reforms recommended by the Commission to ensure a fair process would be $232.7 million per year.

Here are some fact: _The Death Penalty costs more than life imprisonment _There is absolutely no evidence that it deters crime (just look at crime rates in the US compared to Europe wich abolished it) _For every 100 executed prisoners there are likely 4 innocent people being executed _It diminishes society to the same moral level as the criminals _Human behavior is mostly determined by the environment and can be changed by a caring environment (in approx. 80% of violent criminals) -The countries who abolished it usually have lower crime rates then those who didn't _The Death Penalty creates a society that promotes revenge and bloodthirst After all these arguments I know no Death Penalty supporter who was able to give me a valid reason why I should support it. So I'm asking the the Death Penalty supporters in the Debate.org community if they are able to do so (I don't think so but I'm an open-minded individual)",

Instead I am arguing that when systemic and institutionalized problems exist within a group, like racism or extremism, members of that group have an affirmative duty to combat the source of those group-wide issues. In other words, I am arguing that because systemic racism exists within white culture and institutions, white people have a duty to engage their peers who contribute or encourage racism or they themselves are implicitly contributing to racism. Similarly, it could be argued that Christians and Muslims have a duty to reach out to those misusing their faith or they too are contributing to the problem of extremism and hatred via their silence. For example, don't all Catholics have an affirmative duty to combat pedophilia within the Catholic church, since child molestation has been recognized as being a systemic problem within the church? Having a duty to act to change group problems within a group differs from being responsible for the individual actions of members of a group. White people, like people of color, black people or religious groups, have a duty to combat group-wide problems that negatively impact society and their group's reputation. This is wholly distinguishable from holding the entire group responsible or liable for the actions of its members.",

This argument suggests that rich is perhaps on the level of a Gates or Buffet, yet in reality rich is simply a comparative term. This means that IN RELATION to the black and hispanic community of the USA (say) those who are caucasian tend to be financially much better off. According to this rich only means one thing: rich : having a lot of money and possessions another argument that shows that racism and classism have nothing to do with each other is this Appalachia, not Bed-Stuy, Sunset Park, or Compton, is the poorest part of America. Poverty doesn't equate to a dangeorus neighborhood. Factors such as crime, lack of father figure, corruption, urban decay lead to this. Segregation doesn't cause poverty. Spanish and black neighborhoods were some of the most superior neighborhoods during segregation. Blacks and Spanish built their own schools. Most white people are commoners, just like people of every other race. Racism has nothing to do with class. During Jim Crow, most Southerners were commoners who didn't like other races. Classism had nothing to do with racism ever. White privilege implies that rich people are responsible for racism. Dead wrong. In fact, the most common racism came from populists in the USA. Racism is in fact a tribal thing. White privilege doesn't exist. Does white favoritism (favoring of whites over other races in things like legal protection, rights, etc) exist? Yes.

Remember religion as defined is a set of ideas, not just one. My opponent continues to commit the fallacy of composition over and over again. He points out that charity is good and asserts that the set must be good. I on the other hand have argued that forcing charity into a set of other ideas that are both good and bad, is harmful because it would be better to allow charity to stand on its own merits. I don't think my opponent is grasping this. Its this simple: I give a college student a bag of presents, here is what is in the bag: text books for his next set of classes, a e-card for the caf, and a uncaged angry gaboon viper.

You mentioned that teaching multiple religions would cause conflict. I struggle to see how teaching only one religion would be less discriminating, let alone cause less conflict.

So, I will start with this link here: If you go to that site, you will see many quotations from the bible about how homosexuals should be put to death. Since I respect homosexuals and think they are natural (here is a link to sustain my argument: ) I obviously can't accept this. As you can see, a religious book is punishing something natural with death. This leads to discrimination from true bible believers, and is obviously unacceptable. This is a way in which religion is damaging society. Take, for example, the Islamic State. No matter how wrong their interpretation is, it is still an interpretation, and wouldn't exist without the religion in the first place. The crusades are another example; they put thousands to death just to get their holy city back. Moving on, some say religions build morals, but I disagree. Buddhism, which, if you look closely is not a religion, but a philosophy, has morals even without the belief in god (and no Buda was not a god). Besides, what kind of morals does religion sustain in the first place? Back to the first link, Christianity is saying something natural is immoral, even though it obviously isn't. (Here is a link on things the christian god did that I find unacceptable [as well as bible mistakes]: ) And just because someone is not religious, doesn't mean that person doesn't love or care about others, so obviously religions are unnecessary to achieve morality.

Animals speak in several instances in the Bible, the first being the Adam and Eve story. In order for historians to generally consider a document a reliable historical guide, it needs to first abide by the rules of nature. If there was an account in the Civil War of amputees growing back limbs, there is no doubt that this document would be looked upon with severe skepticism. Perhaps some theists could have a different perspective of this phenomenon, but even if there were several eyewitnesses this is not enough to confirm the event. If one has an ""extended"" view of the laws of nature and reality, then I really don't know how to argue against that person besides debating their core premises that make up this reality. Perhaps this debate was better left to a Christian or a Jew with a different perception of the Bible. Frankly, if I truly believed in any of the impossible events listed in the Bible then I would have much less of an obstacle in terms of believing in the rest, and in that sense I understand you.

I've made my case, and I implore that our conception of the possibility of events not be altered by the fact that it was ""a long time ago."" I can't engage Pro on his platform because certain core assumptions were never satisfied. I refuse to ignore blatant impossibilities in arguing about the ""reliability"" of a historical document. Core weakly tried to answer my queries with appealing to ""what if"" the Christian God did exist, but this is something that should have been spelled out in the premise rather than later rounds. From a purely historical view, rather than one that is faith or religion based, any text that claims physical impossibilities should be seriously questioned.

If someone comes up with a very important idea to save the planet such as ""the one child policy"" the media is always quick to gather biased opponents against that person.

The time frame studied seems to be from 1990 to 2003. That was 12 years ago. How do I know things haven't changed since then? Maybe some of the media outlets is under new management? What about online media? Does it account for those? The scale it uses is based off the opinions of actual people. I'm pretty sure the political office make-up has changed since then. 2. This article does seem to be written by people knowledgeable in the field so likely when they mean conservative and liberal, they mean the actual definitions of conservatism and liberalism, neither of which really stem from the ""establishment"" which is how you defined them. 3. In the article, although it only gives 2 media outlets that are classified as right-centrist, it hardly means that the media is ""liberally"" biased. This kind of ties in with the first point but how I do know there aren't other media outlets that just aren't being listed? Also, perhaps I just misunderstand you but to me, a liberally biased media would mean that ALL outlets would have to give a more liberal perspective vs a conservative perspective. Here, with this article I feel you're just trying to say that the number of liberal media outlets outnumber the number of conservatives which again may not be true. Maybe the authors themselves are just liberals... Look forward to your reply.","arguing against another argument; context not quite clear, but not about biased media"

Could you explain your point about the FCC requirement? If you are referring to the Fairness Doctrine, it is my understanding that it was repealed long ago. On the Time Magazine article: You make a good point in saying that publishing a poignant article provoked action on the part of the Israeli government. However, it proves that in this case, the media had a specific agenda, and if it had a particular agenda, then it can no longer claim to be communicating information but rather, opinion. As many regard Time as a news source, it is unacceptable for it to commit such bias. On the Al Jazeera point, if you look closely, you will see that Al Jazeera English does not publish the same material as Al Jazeera in Arabic. It would be much easier simply to translate articles from Arabic than to pay to have new articles written for the English-speaking audience. Because different audiences have different pre-concieved notions of the conflict and also different roles in the conflict itself, Al Jazeera must be conscious of how its audiences can be manipulated by the mere wording, much less content of the articles published.

The issue mentioned in the title is key to the reason why so much negative public perception is directed at guns, and thus why many people shudder at the thought of unrestricted gun ownership. The position I am taking is that the media, while not always intentionally, has shown a clear bias in reporting stories that convey the negatives of gun usage and ownership. Simultaneously, they have failed to give the same treatment towards the stories which exhibit the positives of everyday citizens using guns. My opponent should be of the position that the media fairly covers both the positive and negative occurrences of gun usage, with no inherent bias towards either side.

The government wants a steady and non-chaotic system to the media and wouldn't want anyone to lash out against them. There are three elements in this theory: a covert goal, a deception strategy, and a manipulated outcome. During WWII the Nazi party took over the media. They controlled what was viewed, said, and done. They did not allow anyone to go against what they wanted to be brought out to the people. The theory explains that the government must present illusions to certain media so there is no chaos. They produce stories that will interest all in order to get money.

It is still to this day the most controversial case in American history. People developed dozens of theories because the government hasn't shown the documents to the people. The government has the control not to put out these documents into the media. Even though the audience wants to see them, we have no control of it, the government does. 2.)

The rules on immigration need to come with tough sanctions to ensure that they are not exploited or broken in the future.

""To claim that illegal immigrants don't pay tax is entirely false, most forms of tax are unavoidable."" Illegal immigrants of some kinds are not used to paying taxes.

In addition, businesses, especially if banned from outsourcing, will turn to the equally as detrimental technique of ""in-sourcing,"" or hiring illegal aliens in the U.S. Although the Senate is demanding that employers prove that American workers are ""unwilling or unavailable"" to take these jobs before they hire illegal immigrants, they will find ways around the law in order to make the most profit at the least expense by hiring cheap labor (""Is It""Illegal Immigrants?"").

According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion every year, which amounts to an extra $1,117 per household (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). Illegal immigrants do pay taxes, but this only yields $13 billion per year, leaving a net cost of $100 billion that must be made up by law-abiding citizens. (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). Illegal immigration is clearly unhealthy for America. In fact, the money spent on education and welfare programs for illegal aliens exceeded the budget deficits of 18 states in 2009 (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). If a ""path to citizenship"" were granted, tax revenues from current illegal aliens would certainly increase. However, this yield would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the full welfare benefits to which they would automatically become entitled (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). Therefore, illegal immigration should be discouraged so that the U.S. can dig itself out of its fiscal grave and first provide law-abiding citizens with the care they need.

One must remember that, whatever their reasons, immigrants who have come to this country without legal documentation have broken the law. Just as criminals lose their rights when they break the law, so should illegal immigrants have to face the consequences of their actions. Granting illegal immigrants the same rights as citizens would encourage them continue to break the law instead of seeking the approved path to citizenship (""Is it...Illegal Immigrants?""). Obama's plan to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants involves awarding visas to immigrants who have waited patiently in their countries of origin and to those who broke the law to come here (""Is it...Illegal Immigrants?""). If we award illegal immigrants legal rights, then we are essentially condoning crime. Furthermore, it is inaccurate to assume that illegal immigrants are not benefiting from living in this country already - even without full Social Security benefits. For example, money sent home by illegal immigrants is one of Mexico""s largest sources of revenue after oil sales and exports (""Top Ten Pros and Cons"").

Therefore, illegal immigrants cannot be granted the rights of citizens because it would only encourage unrestrained immigration and an increase in the crime rate. The threat that amnesty poses to national security should also be considered. The majority of terrorist acts committed in the United States have been perpetrated by people from countries abroad. Granting illegal immigrants amnesty would ""open the flood gates,"" relaxing our immigration policies even further and increasing the risk of terrorism (""Top Ten Pros and Cons"").

For example, Iran has endeavoured for years on a clandestine nuclear weapons program that, were it recognized as a legitimate pursuit, could be increased in scale and completed with greater speed. The result of such an achievement could well destabilize the Middle East and would represent a major threat to the existence of a number of states within the region, particularly Israel. Furthermore, the risk of nuclear weapons, or at least weapons-grade material, falling into the hands of dissidents and terrorists increases substantially when there are more of them and larger numbers of countries possess them. Additionally, many countries in the developing world lack the capacity to safely secure weapons if they owned them, due to lack of technology, national instability, and government corruption.[2] Recognizing the rights of these countries to hold nuclear weapons vastly increases the risk of their loss or misuse.

An internationally ratified Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on the testing of nuclear weapons would serve to hamper attempts by countries currently not in possession of nuclear weapons from acquiring them1. Of course, a country could still develop a nuclear weapon without testing, but little faith can be put in a weapon that is entirely untested; all countries that currently possess nuclear weapons conducted tests. A comprehensive and internationally ratified treaty against testing would serve as an important signaling device to countries considering developing nuclear weapons. Just as a taboo has formed around the use of nuclear weapons due to international accords denouncing their use, so too would a ban on testing generate a norm against it. Countries rely on their reputations in international relations; states will fear loss of credibility should they be seen flouting the ban, either by testing weapons themselves or by supplying materials to countries seeking to perform tests. Furthermore, fear of sanction by other countries and the United Nations will prevent states from engaging in nuclear tests for fear of economic and political damage incurred there from. 1 United Nations General Assembly. 1996.

There are a few problems with these sentiments. (i) Pro is presupposing that the U.S. will act responsible with those nuclear weapons. You can't just theorize into existence responsible States. Furthermore seeing as power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, I see no reason to give the U.S. the benefit of the doubt concerning whether they'd choose to use those weapons responsibly and Pro has as of yet provided no reason for us to think so. (ii) Pro is also ignoring the fact that all nuclear weapons were created equal so one country having access to a large number of them doesn't put them in a necessarily superior strategic position relative to countries with only a few nuclear weapons. One can be sure that if Japan or any of its allies had access to any nuclear weapons in 1945, that the U.S. would not have been able to use them on it. Therefore Pro needs to show why other countries can't just use the same strategy against the U.S. to force it into aligning with their interests.

You have to be going the correct speed limit when you hit the sign and when you are increasing your speed leaving town, you cannot increase to the new, higher speed until you come to that sign.

This is often due to the large distances between cities within the U.S. which mean that driving is not a viable strategy should there be time constraints on travel. However, air travel has significant constraints as well such as long boarding times. This causes problems for those people who frequently commute and high speed rail is set to solve these problems. High speed rail provides a large number of significant benefits over air travel in this regard. This is because high speed rail can travel to city centres. Where airports, due to their size and the noise pollution they cause, are limited to the outskirts of a city, trains are not limited in the same way. As such, people can arrive in a much more central area, cutting large amounts of time off their journey. Secondly, high speed rail has no limits on wireless communication or internet in the same way that air travel does. As such, high speed rail is significantly more useful for anyone who wishes to work on the journey. Finally, the weather is incredibly problematic for air travel. This is especially true in the U.S. where a number of areas can be subject to unexpected snow or storms. By comparison, High Speed rail remains comparatively unhindered.[1] [1] “Convenience of High Speed Rail.” US High Speed Rail Association. http://www.ushsr.com/benefits/convenience.html �",Not about speed limits but about high-speed trains

At other times, for example in heavy rain, fog or when street lights have failed, the safe speed is much less than the set limit. Emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks may need to break the limit on occasions, yet are often caught by cameras.

If I am to proceed with arguing against Pascal's wager it is necessary for me to state that I will not be attacking the existence or non-existence of God, but the viability of Pascal's wager. Pascal's wager can be defined that it is in one's own best interest to behave as if God exists, since the possibility of eternal punishment in hell outweighs any advantage of believing otherwise. If God does exist and you believe he existed, there will be an infinite gain for you (eternal peace - heaven). If you did not believe he existed when he actually does, there will be an infinite loss for you (eternal suffering - hell). If God does not exist and you believed he did exist, there is only a finite loss (a tangible loss only for yourself) and if you did not believe God exists when God does not exist, then there is a finite gain (a tangible gain only for yourself). Now I will be arguing against the latter claims of Pascal's Wager. The idea of there being only a finite gain or loss from disbelief is absolutely absurd on the the basis of three premises; 1) What if the God (or Gods) of a different theism existed? In other words, what if you had belief or disbelief in the wrong God? 2) What if the God that does exist, is not the God which we think to exist within the Deisms and Theisms man has created? 3) There is no possible way to have a memory or waking experience of death or life after death, so understanding if you, in fact, gained or lost in a finite or infinite manner, would be impossible to comprehend in our live's waking conscious.",Rather not about the existence of god itself

If the death penalty is not in use, then America will end up spending more money trying to contain criminals from the outside world. Many lives could be saved by each execution of a guilty killer.",

Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights. To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. In Australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. This means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. Benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - It avenges innocent lives - It decreases crime. Without the death penalty -Over population of crime in jail - More criminals roam around - citizen would be feared.

The death penalty goes against many religions who regard it as immoral. A study has shown that death penalty plays virtually no role in deterring criminals. Finally, one of the most obvious points, innocent people have been wrongly executed. This is a mistake that you cannot fix and is a terrible occurrence. If the death penalty was not in place, this would give investigators the time necessary to realize and declare the person innocent instead of just killing them.

Legal experts and statisticians from Michigan and Pennsylvania used the latest techniques to produce a PEER REVIEWED (that is very important for validity) study that showed that at least 4.1% of people who were given the death penalty since the 1970's were later proven as well as anything can be proven to be innocent. This is an impressive figure, because what this shows that, if the point of the death penalty is retribution for families of victims of murder, the death penalty is counter productive when people innocent of that crime are executed. Keep in mind, if you are pro death penalty you are accepting that some people who were innocent will slip through the cracks. Article: Study the article was based on: On top of the counter productivity, I have heard the argument that the death penalty actually costs less than a life sentence, but this is false on every front. 1) Until some one is finally executed the regular prison price is being paid while they are on death row, meaning a death penalty does not get rid of the prison cost. 2)It costs $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 in tax revenue for each death penalty case for trials and appeals, while for an entire 40 years in prison it costs $1,000,000-$1,250,000.

Now many, which I gather you are one of, believe that banning guns will reduce crime rate and have great outcomes. However, this is not the case. By banning guns, you are only taking guns away from the law abiding citizens. Lets take someone who is on the run from the police because they have robbed a bank. Lets also suppose that the government has banned guns. They have already broken the law and decide that they will kill someone. If they have ALREADY broken a law, why do you think they would decide to follow the no guns law? Now I know you may say that if guns were banned no one would be able to get control of guns. But I have current proof that this is not the case. Meth is not a legal drug yet it is still used and up for purchase (black market). Before marijuana was legalized in Colorado, people were found using and owning marijuana. These are things that are banned and in marijuana's case controlled.

P2: Banning guns does decrease death. C: Guns should be banned. In the form of a categorical syllogism.. P1: Whatever decreases deaths should be done. P2: Banning guns, even for cops, decreases deaths. C: Guns should be banned. He's argued for Premise 2, but not Premise 1 of either of these arguments. Why stop with guns? Children drown in bathtubs.

My opponent hasn't explained why guns should be banned, but bathubs shouldn't. He simply insists that they're different. My opponent states that Washington DC has a low murder rate because they banned guns. Well, look, Indianapolis has a much lower murder rate, and guns aren't banned there. There aren't even bans on assault weapons in Indiana (1). What basis do we have to believe that gangsters and shooters couldn't get guns if we banned them? Also, if we banned guns from police officers, they wouldn't be able to enforce the law. What if there were a female police officer going up against an enormous gangster? What if the gangs still had guns, and the police don't? Banning guns won't make guns magically disappear. Drugs are banned, but they still get into the US. So gangs will still have access to guns, and depriving police officers of guns will make them essentially ineffective. What are you going to do when a gang member has a gun, and is shooting people, but none of the police officers have guns?

A gun can help thwart a burglary, allows a person to respond to a lethal threat with equal force, possibly allow someone to stop a mass shooting from escalating if they are living in a concealed-carry region, and in very depopulated states like Wyoming and Alaska where people routinely have to hunt to get food, guns come in handy. Guns should not be banned since there are some good uses for them that justifies their existence 2) Impossibility of collecting all the guns if they are banned Lets say you ban guns. Great, now how do you go about actually collecting all of them? Just because you ban guns, that doesn't mean everyone will be willing to actually turn in their guns, even if given an incentive. There will be people who will hang on to their guns if they are banned, and since it would be literally impossible for the government to legally confiscate all guns, banning them is a bad idea since its pretty much unenforceable.",

If the government were to ask everyone to hand there guns in then only law abiding citizens would comply, then only criminals would own guns, then who has the power? Despite the fact that it was senseless, I will respond to your side of the argument. You are proposing that if no one has a gun, then no one has power over one another. At least that's what I believe you think, as you hadn't gone as far as to state what you meant. In that case then people would resort to other weapons, or make there own guns. In any way, the can of worms has been opened, and making a law that disarms no one except the law abiding citizen will do nothing to help matters.

My opening argument: Black people have been discriminated against for centuries. They have been used as slaves and segregated. Racism is rude, insensitive and hurtful. Not only does it harm people's feelings, but can also cause a certain friction between races of which can lead to a full out war. What happened in Ferguson serves as proof that prejudice between a cop and a black citizen led to riots.

This means that IN RELATION to the black and hispanic community of the USA (say) those who are caucasian tend to be financially much better off. According to this rich only means one thing: rich : having a lot of money and possessions another argument that shows that racism and classism have nothing to do with each other is this Appalachia, not Bed-Stuy, Sunset Park, or Compton, is the poorest part of America. Poverty doesn't equate to a dangeorus neighborhood. Factors such as crime, lack of father figure, corruption, urban decay lead to this. Segregation doesn't cause poverty. Spanish and black neighborhoods were some of the most superior neighborhoods during segregation. Blacks and Spanish built their own schools. Most white people are commoners, just like people of every other race. Racism has nothing to do with class. During Jim Crow, most Southerners were commoners who didn't like other races. Classism had nothing to do with racism ever. White privilege implies that rich people are responsible for racism. Dead wrong. In fact, the most common racism came from populists in the USA.

Indeed, letting the editor of a newspaper know that all of his rivals had decided not to run a story would seem to be a sure fire way of guaranteeing that he would put it on the front page.

""Liberal bias"" will be defined as a tendency to present news stories with the agenda of elevating policies or stances that are conventionally called liberal. This may be in the form of excluding or distorting information to serve this goal, as well as devoting time to certain issues or politicians unevenly.

It is instead to inform the public and provide entertainment. However, it would be na�ve and short-sighted to believe that the media should report and cover everything equally so as to perfectly inform the public. The nature of media coverage is such that there is a limited amount each media company can cover. There is a limit on air-time available to radio and TV stations and there is a limit to the number of pages newspapers can print. Media companies thus have to make a choice regarding what to report and to what extent. It makes sense for more coverage to be offered for stories and events that are deemed to be of greater importance by the general public (irrespective of its objective value). For example, news about local flooding in Queensland Australia may be hugely important for Australians, but considerably less so for people in Europe or the Americas. Similarly, a British victory at the World Schools Debating Championships would not be (by and large) seen as important as a British victory in the Football or Rugby World Cup. We would thus expect the media to cover each story according to its popularity. Given the considerably lower public interest in most women’s sport compared to men’s, it thus makes sense for men’s to receive more media coverage. That coverage is based on popularity rather than media bias is shown by more than two thirds of media reports not in any way enhancing stereotypes, the media are therefore not specifically discriminating against women in sport.[1] [1] ‘Sports, Media and Stereotypes Women and Men in Sports and Media’, Centre for Gender Equality, 2006,�p.19.",

Could you explain your point about the FCC requirement? If you are referring to the Fairness Doctrine, it is my understanding that it was repealed long ago. On the Time Magazine article: You make a good point in saying that publishing a poignant article provoked action on the part of the Israeli government. However, it proves that in this case, the media had a specific agenda, and if it had a particular agenda, then it can no longer claim to be communicating information but rather, opinion. As many regard Time as a news source, it is unacceptable for it to commit such bias. On the Al Jazeera point, if you look closely, you will see that Al Jazeera English does not publish the same material as Al Jazeera in Arabic. It would be much easier simply to translate articles from Arabic than to pay to have new articles written for the English-speaking audience. Because different audiences have different pre-concieved notions of the conflict and also different roles in the conflict itself, Al Jazeera must be conscious of how its audiences can be manipulated by the mere wording, much less content of the articles published.

Prophecy is an example of this. People argue either that there are contradictions in the Bible or point out the ""genocide"" found in the Bible. War and genocide does not prove the Bible is unreliable. However, contradictions can question the reliability of the Bible. Some try to point out that the Bible contains scientific faults which would fall in the category of contradictions with so called learned knowledge. Evolution would be such an example. However, evolution without it's origins (how it started, cosmology) ends up being adaptation. People try to split evolution from it's origins to try and built a case that cannot be argued against, but as I pointed out, it because adaptation. The origin theory is a theory. It cannot be proven by scientific methods and cannot be verified using the scientific method, so in short, how can the Bible contradict something that cannot be proven? The Bible warns against science ""falsely so called"". Others point out events that seem to contradict who God should be and what He should and should not allow.

There are other books out there that claim they're based on true stories. Most of these stories even have a mythical fantasy beast that sounds too good to be true. But according to you, just because it sounds too good to be true, doesn't mean it's not real. For example, the Quran, a book used by muslims. The Quran is nearly as old as the bible and it's followers claim that there is no solid evidence to prove the Quran has ever been altered/editied. But, the Quran is a book very different from ours.

This is a very crucial element to this debate. I will not be arguing against religion - I happen to be an Atheist - but this debate is specifically about the link between religion and morality. Morality may be an aspect of religion, but religion is not specifically a part of morality. According to greatergood.berekely.edu, ""[t]here is a spectrum of views about how religion and ethics are related—from the view that religion is the absolute bedrock of ethics to one that holds that ethics is based on humanistic assumptions justified mainly, and sometimes only, by appeals to reason. These two extremes tend to be argued in a way that offers little room for compromise or pragmatic solutions to real issues we face everyday."" The source continues with, ""[e]ven though religious and secular ethics don’t derive their authority from the same source, we still must find a way to establish common ground between them; otherwise we’re condemning ourselves to live amidst social discord and division."" They are not from the same source, but they do have commonalities. Religion is connected to morals, while morals are not necessarily connected to religion.

Religion is not necessarily in opposition to science. Science is a way for us to test the physical world around us using a method that relies on strictly on the tangible nature of the universe. Religion on the other hand has more to do with a spiritual understanding of one's self. A person does not necessarily join a religion in order to understand the universe but more to help guide themselves toward happiness or enlightenment of some sort. Religion is very abstract and comes in many different forms. It is very similar to art in the sense that it is completely subjective to the individual's taste and does not necessarily rely on the outside world. That being said, religion has many benefits toward a person and their growth. Just about every religion encourages love and caring for others. Following a religion has nothing to do with a person's ignorance. There are many knowledgeable and wise people who follow religions and there are many ignorant people who don't. In the past, religions tended to be anthropomorphic and the gods were flawed and human like. As we evolved, religion became more abstract and grew as our scientific understanding grew. Most religions today tend to be monotheistic or pantheistic but there are even some atheistic religions out there. As we grow, the religions we know today will fade but new ones will sprout.",

So what has the introduction of universal coverage brought the French? Costs and waiting lists. France’s system of single-payer health coverage goes like this: the taxpayers fund a state insurer called Assurance Maladie, so that even patients who cannot afford treatment can get it. Now although, at face value, France spends less on healthcare and achieves better public health metrics (such as infant mortality), it has a big problem. The state insurer has been deep in debt since 1989, which has now reached 15 billion euros.[1] Another major problem with universal health care efficiency is waiting lists. In 2006 in Britain it was reported that almost a million Britons were waiting for admission to hospitals for procedures. In Sweden the lists for heart surgery are 25 weeks long and hip replacements take a year. Very telling is a ruling by the Canadian Supreme Court, another champion of universal health care: “access to a waiting list is not access to health care”.[2] Universal health coverage does sound nice in theory, but the dual cancers of costs and waiting lists make it a subpar option when looking for a solution to offer Americans efficient, affordable and accessible health care.

There are several flaws in my opponent's argument, which I will attack in this round. Rebuttal: One flaw is that ""Billy"" could not afford health insurance and needed free universal health care. Universal health care is not actually ""free"". The way the government funds universal health care is through taxes. Every worker in France pays about 50% of their paycheck each month into health care. If the United States had universal health care, Billy would not be able to even afford food, and it would be unfair to the U.S. as a whole because every worker would have half as much money, and would also be paying for other people. Secondly, is the idea that he got turned away from the hospital. That would be impossible, as it is illegal for a hospital to refuse emergency medical service due to a lack of insurance or money. Even so, Billy could have received free treatment from a non-profit or government-run hospital.",

I am actually on the fence about this issue. Perhaps this debate will allow me to learn enough to take a defined stance. For the purposes of this debate, I will argue against the resolution. My starting points shall be: Every human being ought to be good stewards of their own body, responsible for their own health and well-being. I argue that a Government is no more responsible for your health care, than it is for raising your children. To demand Government health care, would be shifting the burden of personal health accountability. Health care costs money. The only way to pay for health care is to maintain an employed work-force to contribute taxes for social programs like health care. That makes Government sponsored health care an oxymoron. If you are employed, you have access to company health care. The only people who who actually benefit from Government sponsored health care, are the unemployed. Private health care creates healthy competition between medical providers. It serves as an incentive for doctors to practice quality medicine. Social health care programs would eliminate competition and remove incentive for doctors to provide above-standard care. The patient would lose their person-hood and be regarded as a case number to be absolved, so that an annual health care audit would not flag the case. Social health care would create an assembly line ""rotating door"" system. (See military Tricare for active duty military personnel).",

If the government bans abortion then they would be forcing a woman to have a child. If a pregnant woman doesn't have an abortion then she is going to have a child. So if the government takes away that right then pregnant women will have no choice but to have a child. Adoption is a option that is not used often after a woman gives birth to a child. Most women don't want to put their child up for adoption. If the government bans abortion then some women will have an unsafe abortion. More women will have an unsafe abortion if abortion is illegal. Every year approximately 78,000 women die from unsafe abortion. If abortion is legal then less unsafe abortions will occur. Abortion is a safe medical procedure. 88% of women who have an abortion do so in their first trimester. Medical abortions have less than 0.5% risk of serious complications and do not affect a woman's health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth. The government should make sure that late term abortion is safe. The fetus is in the woman's body so therefore the government should not control their bodies.

Being pregnant and knowing you MUST deliver a baby you had no consent in making puts a lot of stress on the rape victim. It adds to the trauma. Rape is not a good thing, even if a baby comes out of it. Another thing is that women aren't entirely helpless. They take precautions. Some are black belts and others carry pepper spray or a gun. And why should we penalize women for being the victim? Another thing is that banning abortion will not stop it, just like how the Prohibition Act did not stop alcohol. The only thing an abortion ban will stop is safe abortions. Women who do not want a baby will still try it on themselves, without the help of a doctor. And trying abortion without a doctor is extremely risky. This could not just kill the baby, but it's dangerous to the woman as well.

Enforcing an abortion ban would require a quite degrading and inhumane treatment of those women who wished to have their fetus terminated. Moreover, if pregnant women traveled abroad, they would be able to have an abortion in a country where it was legal. Either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement, or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it. The middle way of tacitly accepting foreign terminations would render hypocritical the much-vaunted belief in the sanctity of life. The demand for abortions will always exist; making abortion illegal, will simply drive it underground and into conditions where the health and safety of the woman might be put at risk.1 Example: Polish women, living in a country with extremely restrictive abortion laws often go abroad to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria for abortions.2 Women who are not lucky enough to live in environments such as the EU may be forced to go to foreign countries and undergo underground, unsafe abortions. 1 WARSAW BUSINNES JOURNAL",

I would first like to state that, there are many reasons there should not be a ban on abortion. First of all, it is the mother's choice, and the mother's choice alone. Simple as that. Post-abortion guilt. These effects do not always take place. Suppose a woman got raped, and she was worried about the child she was to have. She could, very easily, feel relief in getting an abortion, knowing that there will not be any other long-term effects. Although this seems a bit immoral, I do not think a growing fetus should be considered a human. Just like an apple seed should not be considered an apple tree. And although this seems just as immoral, it is not an independet creature. It lives much like a parisite, living off of it's host. Some may say that, when a pregnant mother is killed, it is counted as double murder. And because of this, there should be a ban, right? Wrong.

However, nowhere in the constitution is any provision made for any abortion. While there are indeed certain clauses that seemingly would allow them in principle, I see no place where it is stated, mainly because it was never an issue in the time of the founding of the US. Furthermore, My opponent has generalized those who will receive an abortion as those “who are either not ready or too poor to support a child.” While this summarizes some of those who will receive an abortion, this certainly cannot be true of all or even a majority of those who will receive an abortion. Then, my opponent uses an appeal to pity and asks the question “Would you like to be unwanted? Dirt poor? Malnourished?” As if the choice to ban abortion will lead to a bunch of poor malnourished children lying in the streets with cardboard signs saying “feed me” My opponent then states that if we ban abortion, the immediate result is children dying and suffering in this world. While this may be true for some cases, this is by no means a general rule. It also is a slippery slope, that if we do this one thing, this exact thing will happen to everyone, therefore, the first thing should not happen.

Climate change is a problem that transcends all human made boudaries and lays hand on all aspects of society. When addressing climate change, a country has to do so from many angles - the economic sector, the power sector, the environmental section, etc. etc. In most countries, ministries already exist for these sectors, and while making decisions on climate change, it would be very confusing to decide which ministry makes which decision. For example, when deciding on renewable energy - a policy to reduce carbon emmissions, the question arises who will oversee this - the energy/electricity ministry, or the climate change ministry. When allocating funds for climate change prevention and mitigation, the question arises - who will oversee this - the economic ministry or the climate change ministry. Climate change is a central problem that has to be addressed from all sides. THere are already relevant ministries on all sides that can take this action. A climate change ministry would simply make the other ministries inefficient in taking action, while not being able to be efficient itself.

We need to take drastic measures to reduce man made Co2 levels ASAP. I've become convinced of this due to the climate change deniers. Simply, put the climate change deniers are correct, there is not enough evidence. Therefore, we need to accumulate more evidence via experimentation. Thus far all we have done is endlessly discuss if climate change is real or false and collecting observation evidence. Empirical evidence is split into two grounds. A. Observation evidence B. Scientific experiments All I've seen is A, thus far. We need B, and we need to know soon. The only way I can imagine to test this theory of global climate change is via experimentation. We must take control and change a variable. I vote Co2 is the best variable. Now as Co2 as the variable we have two choices, to raise or lower Co2 levels. Considering it would be immoral to raise Co2 levels given the observation evidence, we can only lower Co2 levels. Since a small decrease in Co2 levels would be more difficult to determine, a large decrease in amount of Co2 produced by man made sources is the only solution. That way if climate change is caused by a confounding factor we will have a better chance of acknowledging that confounding factor and taking corrective actions. To recap, we need more evidence for whether or not climate change is true in the form of experimental evidence. Lowering man-made Co2 dramatically is the best and only moral option.

Also burden of proof will be 51% on my opponent and 49% on me. Manmade global climate change is the general increase in temperature at rapid rates that is mainly caused by CO2 from industry increases. Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. [0] Although 1.4 degrees doesn't sound much, it ends up being a lot. This is because not all areas of the world heat at the same rate and such a rapid change is hard to adapt to. There is no signs of relief from climate change. My opponent will attempt to deny climate change, but please remember how long the cigarette companies held out despite the science being heavily against them. Now we know as sure as the sun rises that cigarettes cause cancer. I can honestly state that as sure as the sun rises, global climate change is upon us and is a threat. Al Gore's inconvenient truth is still a master piece, and I will not accept defeat until my opponent can defeat the documentary. [1] Not watching Al Gore's documentary is no excuse. If your a serious climate change denier, it just makes you look uncommitted and shallow to criticize climate change without watching the premier documentary. Thank you for reading.

Definitions Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power. Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning. Arguments Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power. Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist. Donald Trump's asinine claims about Mexican criminals being ""rapists"" and ""murderers"" are akin to the Sith's attempts to criminalize the Jedi near the fall of the Old Republic. Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers- Donald Trump has been observed wearing traditional Sith cloaks, and has been seen commanding armies of Stormtroopers. This guarantees his connection with the Dark Side. [1][2] Sources",

Because when Muslims are deported from the USA, they will begin to develop a hatred towards America, just like ISIS. Afterwards, ISIS will be able to recruit more members because there will be a greater hatred towards the USA. Not only that, but Donald Trump will ruin relations with Mexico when he builds the wall, Mexico will therefore stop trading with the USA and the US will need to get cheap labor from somewhere, right? So, they turn to China and other countries like India and Indonesia to manufacture their goods. Donald Trump will not bring more jobs to the USA, he has already been exposed of outsourcing jobs for his company to China and India. Also, Donald Trump will abolish the IRS and introduce a flat tax rate, which benefits the rich and has a negative effect on the poor.

Feel free to refer back to me previous links and/or argument. You're statement "" No, VIOLENCE is spreading throughout the world."" does not disprove that gay marriage and gay rights protests do not cause violence. Your blatant and extremely broad statement implies that violence is a result without a cause. For example, your statement would have made more sense if you said somewhere along the lines of this: ""No, VIOLENCE is spreading throughout the world because of or as a result of..."". Gay rights protests (not all) can and certainly could become violent (see links provided in previous argument). From your link ( The Slippery Slope is a fallacy in which a person asserts that some event must inevitably follow from another without any argument for the inevitability of the event in question. By linking this, I see that you greatly misunderstood what I said. I'm not using the ""Slippery Slope"" fallacy because I never (and never will) claim that all gay rights protests inevitably end in violence, but rather claim that they can cause violence, thus causing harm on not only American society, but all around the world as well. P.S. Gay marriage causes tensions between Pro and Anti gay marriage activists. Tensions between said activists lead to gay rights protests (not anti gay rights protests because majority of the issue [average of past 10 years] support anti gay marriage, numbers will be below). Gay rights protests lead to even more tensions, some of which can become hostile and violent.

People try to argue that gay marriage is wrong, my question is how? Because the bible said so? First of all you can't argue that gay marriage is wrong because the bible said so, there are many religions out there and not all of them say that gay marriage is wrong. Second of all why does it even effect you and why are you so worried about what other people are doing? Mind your own business and don't worry about the small things like gay marriage. If two people are happy let them be, they are not interfering you, so why interfere with theirs? And if gay marriage is wrong then so is sex before marriage, and probably more than half of you out there have had sex before marriage.

0033,00015398,00000004,True,Pro,4,3,3,4,Gay marriage should be legal.,"I am not advocating for the government to tell the church what to do. Legalizing gay marriage does not command the church to act in one way or another, it only requires the government to permit gay marriages to be granted -by the government. Marriage, as an institution, is subject to tremendous governmental regulation -at present by individual states. It is taxed, subsidized, incentivized, and even defined -by every state other than MA and a few others, as between man and one woman. It is that definition, and only that definition, that legalizing gay marriage will change. Legalizing gay marriage will permit one man to marry another man, or one woman to marry another woman -as the government recognizes marriage. Wether the church should desire to perform gay marriage, endorse gay marriage, or support the practice of gay marriage is a matter entirely for the church to sort out. While it was originally the case that marriage was a religious thing, it is more than that now. That it was once only a religious thing does not mean that it has not transcended its origins. Christmas is celebrated by atheists, just as much as non-religious people get married (even if they are straight). As to the health insurance effects of gay marriage, I'm not sure it is appropriate to be discussing the finite details of intercourse on this medium and so I will abstain from doing so. I will only say that there are exceptionally effective means to prevent the spread of disease that are readily available at any pharmacy, grocery store, or gas station.",
0033,00030335,00000005,True,Con,3,1,1,1,Gay Marriage,"I shall argue against gay marriage: 1) Gay Marriage is not marriage Simply calling a marriage a marriage does not mean it is a marriage. Marriage always has been a covenant between man and woman. It is by nature that a marriage is to unify a man and a woman, not a woman and a woman or a man and a man. 2) Gay Marriage goes against nature. Marriage serves two purposes: to unify and to procreate. A man and a man cannot create another human. Only a man and a woman can do that. Let me give you an analogy: say I have a chair. A chair, defined in a dictionary, is something used to sit on. That is the chair's nature. Not to stand on or throw. Standing on the chair or throwing the chair defeats the chair's purpose. You see, if you do anything else other than sit on the chair, you have a risk of breaking the chair or harming yourself. In a way, this chair is marriage. A marriage by nature is man and woman. Anything other than that defeats its purpose and risks to damage the beauty of marriage. 3) Gay Marriage, even if right in society's eyes, are wrong morally. From a religious standpoint, it is morally wrong and against God's will to support gay marriage. This is not saying that being gay is wrong, in fact, it might a good thing. However, the gay ACTS are not. Thank you for your time. This is all I will support for now.",

While private politicians are certainly among those who support gay marriage, by your argument any law passed represents corruption. You fail to explain how gay marriage is not in the public good, so I clicked over to the comments, where you stated that gay marriage wasn't in the public interest because only heterosexual marriages produce children. Yet this makes zero sense as a condemnation of gay marriage; it's not like gay people would be having kids if gay marriage was ILLegal. In fact, gay marriage can help alleviate the problem of heterosexual marriages that don't work and leave children in the foster home system, since gay couples adopt much more regularly and tend to be better parents than heterosexual couples (2). Anyway, only 3.8% of Americans identify as LGBTQ, and whether or not they have kids has very little effect on the population anyway. Unless you're some kind of a spread-the-race nationalist, I can't see why this argument holds water.

One reason for being against gay marriage is that it offends God.In the bible,Angels were sent to destroy the city of Sodom and Gomorrah because of its wickedness.What were the examples of this great wickedness?Gay marriage is among them and this was what made the angels more angry.The question is do you get angry at good things?No,of course{Gen.19:24-25}. Another reason is that marriage is meant to be for males and females.If God is/was in support of gay marriage,He would have not wasted his time in creating females or He would have destroyed the females.What you,my learned opponent is trying to say is that God is stupid and ignorant for creating females. Also,gay marriage violates procreation.Jesus Christ did not come into the world through a man.He came through a woman because women are supposed to give birth not males.Gay marriage does not bring about procreation.Instead,it brings about the so-called pleasure.Albert Einstein is not a product of gay marriage.Shakespeare is not,Aristotle is not and so many great men.

This means that we have millions of new people who speak Spanish and not English, meaning they cannot communicate with a lot of the population. Illegals (and some legals, but that's beside the point) don't bother learning English. This could lead to American culture being damaged as a whole, since they choose not to assimilate into our culture. Most of my info comes from: Adios, America! by Ann Coulter",Most claims unjustified.

Illegal immigrant is helpful to our economy. Immigrants illegally entering united states is good because they help out our economy. They make up the 5% of the total number of USA labor force. Illegal immigrant pay taxes which help fund USA economy. 2. Illegal immigrants work for low cost. Illegal immigrants do the same job as any native and for a cheaper wage. 3.Illegal Immigrant support big businesses.

According to the Center for Immigration Studies, 57% of both legal and illegal immigrant homes are receiving the benefits of at least one welfare program (""Is it""Illegal Immigrants?""). If granted amnesty, illegal immigrants would become eligible for full benefits and the burden on legal, taxpaying citizens would increase drastically. In addition, businesses, especially if banned from outsourcing, will turn to the equally as detrimental technique of ""in-sourcing,"" or hiring illegal aliens in the U.S. Although the Senate is demanding that employers prove that American workers are ""unwilling or unavailable"" to take these jobs before they hire illegal immigrants, they will find ways around the law in order to make the most profit at the least expense by hiring cheap labor (""Is It""Illegal Immigrants?""). For these reasons, only legal immigration should be supported in the United States. Works Cited ""Is it a Bad Idea to Legalize the Illegal Immigrants?"" Illegal Immigration Statistics. 2013.

According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion every year, which amounts to an extra $1,117 per household (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). Illegal immigrants do pay taxes, but this only yields $13 billion per year, leaving a net cost of $100 billion that must be made up by law-abiding citizens. (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). Illegal immigration is clearly unhealthy for America. In fact, the money spent on education and welfare programs for illegal aliens exceeded the budget deficits of 18 states in 2009 (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). If a ""path to citizenship"" were granted, tax revenues from current illegal aliens would certainly increase. However, this yield would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the full welfare benefits to which they would automatically become entitled (""Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer""). Therefore, illegal immigration should be discouraged so that the U.S. can dig itself out of its fiscal grave and first provide law-abiding citizens with the care they need.

Illegal immigrants are legally obligated to pay taxes, and they owe the government for allowing them to live and work in this country. One must remember that, whatever their reasons, immigrants who have come to this country without legal documentation have broken the law. Just as criminals lose their rights when they break the law, so should illegal immigrants have to face the consequences of their actions. Granting illegal immigrants the same rights as citizens would encourage them continue to break the law instead of seeking the approved path to citizenship (""Is it...Illegal Immigrants?""). Obama's plan to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants involves awarding visas to immigrants who have waited patiently in their countries of origin and to those who broke the law to come here (""Is it...Illegal Immigrants?""). If we award illegal immigrants legal rights, then we are essentially condoning crime. Furthermore, it is inaccurate to assume that illegal immigrants are not benefiting from living in this country already - even without full Social Security benefits. For example, money sent home by illegal immigrants is one of Mexico""s largest sources of revenue after oil sales and exports (""Top Ten Pros and Cons""). This revenue drains money away from the millions of unemployed and poor Americans who need help, and proves once again that illegal immigrants should not automatically be granted legal rights and receive the same benefits as citizens.

One is more likely to die from a car accident than from drowning, but does that mean swimming safety should be taken any less seriously? In 2011, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,000 people from this country, the highest number ever, and fifty-five percent of them were convicted criminals (""Republicans...crimes""). Therefore, illegal immigrants cannot be granted the rights of citizens because it would only encourage unrestrained immigration and an increase in the crime rate. The threat that amnesty poses to national security should also be considered. The majority of terrorist acts committed in the United States have been perpetrated by people from countries abroad. Granting illegal immigrants amnesty would ""open the flood gates,"" relaxing our immigration policies even further and increasing the risk of terrorism (""Top Ten Pros and Cons""). The highly reputable Center for Immigration Studies predicts that, as the requirements for citizenship become easier to obtain, immigrants will create false documents just to obtain green cards or amnesty, heightening the risk of terrorists slipping through the cracks (""Is it...Illegal Immigrants?"").

The January 2002 Nuclear Posture Review made it clear that the US should change the way it viewed nuclear weapons as different from other arms, and integrate nuclear with non-nuclear tactical weaponry. Yet a moral stigma has been associated with nuclear weaponry since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, meaning that world leaders have been desperate not to use them - so they are different. With the world’s only superpower breaking the nuclear taboo, they lose any moral leverage they have over countries who do not have nuclear weaponry but are seeking to acquire it.\ Even worse, states like North Korea and Iran can justifiably see the development of mini-nukes as an aggressive step by the US to develop weapons designed for use against them, thus giving them a greater justification for developing their own nuclear weapons in response.\ The US should remember that nuclear weapons are the great leveller: a state like Iran will never have the funds or technology to match the conventional weaponry that the US can bring to bear, but with just one nuclear weapon all that conventional weaponry becomes almost irrelevant. The more states which feel the nuclear taboo has been broken or that they are under threat from the USA, the more states that will develop their own nuclear weapons and the less able the US will be to use its conventional forces as a genuine deterrent. \",

It would simply mean that the current nuclear weapons states would have even less influence over them and those 'rogue' regimes would now be able to blackmail the rest of the world as the threat of massive retaliation would have dissapeared. Nuclear weapons are no longer the preserve of the perminant five members of the security council and as proliforation spreads it becomes much more difficult to have complete disarmament. There are essentially too many parties that have the capability to have nuclear weapons or have them already and too little gain out of disarming when you gain so much by being the only one with nuclear weapons.",

Even though the Non-Proliferation treaty restricts its signatories from employing this nuclear technology into the production of nuclear weapons, this is where the problem lies. When Nuclear reactor technology is exported to countries around the world, they can use that technology to manufacture nuclear weapons. Countries like Pakistan, India, North Korea and Israel are not signatories of the Non-proliferation treaty because they are involved in regional conflicts and it is essential for them to develop their nuclear weaponry just to gain political power and influence in the region. North Korea started its nuclear program in the 1950s with the assistance of the United States, the aim was to set up Nuclear Powered energy plants, but over the course of the last few decades, it has employed the same knowledge of nuclear systems to make nuclear weapons. Hence when we transfer Nuclear Reactor technology, we are providing more and more counties a chance to develop Nuclear weapons which can easily be manufactured from materials and supplies which are available to those countries which have Nuclear Power plants. When it comes to the sovereignty of a state, it will be willing to take all measures necessary to protect its self, and the export of Nuclear reactor technology will give more countries the opportunity to use it as a tool to develop nuclear weapons, just like in the case of North Korea which withdrew from the Non-Proliferation treaty did, despite of the pressure it faces from the international community for its nuclear weapons program.[[",

Countries with nuclear weapons have no incentive to engage in open military conflict with one another; all recognize that they will suffer destruction if they choose the path of war.[1] If countries have nuclear weapons, fighting simply becomes too costly. This serves to defuse conflicts, and reduce the likelihood of the outbreak of war. For example, the conflict between India and Pakistan was defused by the acquisition of nuclear weapons by both sides. Before they obtained nuclear weapons, they fought three wars that claimed millions of lives. Relations between the two states, while still far from cordial, have never descended into open war. The defusing of the immediate tension of war, has given the chance for potential dialogue.[2] A similar dynamic has been played out a number of times in the past, and as of yet there has never been a war between two nuclear powers.

An internationally ratified Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on the testing of nuclear weapons would serve to hamper attempts by countries currently not in possession of nuclear weapons from acquiring them1. Of course, a country could still develop a nuclear weapon without testing, but little faith can be put in a weapon that is entirely untested; all countries that currently possess nuclear weapons conducted tests. A comprehensive and internationally ratified treaty against testing would serve as an important signaling device to countries considering developing nuclear weapons. Just as a taboo has formed around the use of nuclear weapons due to international accords denouncing their use, so too would a ban on testing generate a norm against it. Countries rely on their reputations in international relations; states will fear loss of credibility should they be seen flouting the ban, either by testing weapons themselves or by supplying materials to countries seeking to perform tests. Furthermore, fear of sanction by other countries and the United Nations will prevent states from engaging in nuclear tests for fear of economic and political damage incurred there from. 1 United Nations General Assembly. 1996.

This is one of the main reasons why NATO members are implementing the treaty by reducing the nuclear arms. Thanks to NPT the number of nuclear arms has drastically decreased. NATO acceptance of this treaty is with a purpose of contributing to world peace. Nevertheless, the world is a dangerous place and even though NATO is no longer threatened by the Warsaw pact, there are still countries whose nuclear weapons are risk to NATO. That’s why NATO must continue with this program in order to maintain the balance with its potential foes. Having experience from the Cold War, NATO and the world can’t allow another nuclear arms race. The idea of Nuclear Sharing Program (NSP) is to allocate the existing nuclear weapons instead of producing new ones (which is contrary to the NPT). With this Program the members which already have nuclear weapons (USA, Britain and France, but only the United States has provided weapons for nuclear sharing),the participating countries carry out consultations and take common decisions on nuclear weapons policy, maintain technical equipment required for the use of nuclear weapons and store nuclear weapons on their territory. However, the nuclear weapons stored in non-nuclear countries are guarded by US soldiers in US bases and the codes required for detonating them are under U.S. control. This means that the nuclear weapons can’t be misused and that the NPT articles aren’t broken, because the competence over them remains in the arms of the NWS, not of the NNWS. This not only prevents new nuclear build ups, but also increases the safety of NATO Alliance and with that they are fulfilling their own goal.",

This is because nuclear weapons are extremely deadly, If the heat dont kill you that goes about 6 miles killing instantly then the blast or radiation will. Nuclear weapons also cause a EMP so medical attention or support is going to take some time. Nuclear weapons are also a threat to everyone not providing the most happiness to the greatest number of people. Contention 2: Nuclear weapons are in every since of the word paper weights, This is because nuclear weapons only deter nuclear weapons. If state A Conventionally attacks state B and they both have nukes, state B will of course attack back with conventional weapons. In which case nuclear weapons have not deterred or stopped this conflict and Mutually Assured Destruction has done nothing and falls.

The reason for maintaining an effective nuclear arsenal is in fact to prevent war. By making the results of conflict catastrophic, a strategic deterrent discourages conflict. The Cold War was in fact one of the most peaceful times in history, particularly in Europe, largely because of the two superpowers' nuclear deterrents: ‘the principal function of nuclear weapons was to deter nuclear attack’ (Record, 2004). During the Gulf War, for example, one of the factors which prevented Iraq from launching missiles tipped with chemical weapon warheads against Israel was the threat the USA would retaliate with a nuclear strike. Although there is no longer as formal a threat of retaliation as there was during the Cold War, the very possibility that the use of nuclear weapons by a rogue state could be met a retaliatory strike is too great a threat to ignore. Moreover, although the citizens of the current nuclear powers may be against the use of force against civilians, their opinions would rapidly change if they found weapons of mass destruction being used against them.",

0040,00040306,00000003,True,Con,3,2,2,2,There should be sections of interstate with no speed limit.,"Athenseric, think about this there is a 60 year old grandma driving a civic down one of the parts of the interstate with no speed limit, then this 25 year old guy in a Hennessey venom gt comes barreling down the road at 250 miles an hour, and that guy is right behind her on the same lane, while he is racing with his friends, what do you think is going to happen, boom crash slam right? That is way this nation has speed limits, to protect the people from getting hurt. Speed is the cause of most accidents that tend to be fatal, I quote from ""Speed was a factor in 30 percent (12,477) of all traffic fatalities in 1998, second only to alcohol (39 percent) as a cause of fatal crashes."" And that was when there were less cars, the world is making cars at a rate of 59,929,016 per year, and that number is constantly growing. So imagine, with more cars, the more the chance of an accident. In 1995 in Congress they raised the speed limit to 85 miles an hour on several highways, then the American journal of public health analyzed the effects of the 1995 act, it resulted in a 3.2 percent increase in road fatalities(accidents). Imagine that, by just raising the speed limit hundreds of more people died, so picture what would happen if we gave the people free run on some interstates. Millions of more deaths would happen.",
