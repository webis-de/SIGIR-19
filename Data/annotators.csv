0007,male,21.0,Why is it not possible to choose a generalised gender in this survey? or: Why are we forced to get in lane with the binary male/female model?

0017,male,19.0,"It was not quite clear whether counter-arguments are also relevant to the scenario, because the person searching for them could refute them during he/she is writing the letter"

0020,male,38.0,"Rather few con speed limits arguments at all ... a lot off-topic ones on ""term limits"" ..."
0021,male,38.0,I was not too satisfied with the judged arguments' quality ... needed about 15--20 minutes since most of the passages where rather long and involved.
0022,male,38.0,"I got the impression that I got a rather balanced set of pro and con ... and had the feeling that this set of arguments in general by far was the ""best"" I had judged out of 4 ... took 5--10 minutes"

0024,male,24.0,"Man müsste diese Umfrage in einem größeren Stichproben und vor allem nicht nur unter Stiftis durchführen lassen, da die die ganzen gun ban argumente eh schwachsinnig finden"

0027,male,37.0,"I found it difficult to separate relevance to scenario from contributes in general; these will be highly correlated. Furthermore, the so-called ""arguments"" were unfortunately hardly arguments at all, but many meta remarks. Also, there were some ridiculous ones, and replys to them, indicating a discussion going on. This is hardly useful for a search result, since I do not want to look at discussions in a split-up way, but want at least threads to be grouped coherently.

Anyhow, as per the scenario, I could glean perhaps one or two arguments relating to historical interpretation and supernatural events from the arguments given. No more."

0029,male,37.0,Interesting to note that con-arguments were of much higher writing quality than the pro-arguments.

0033,male,37.0,"It is difficult to appreciate the con arguments here, since they are all blatantly stupid, compared to pro arguments."

0036,male,21.0,"very hard to judge these questions. In principle most were somewhat relevant, but were missing real arguments. They were more statements and I needed to think about it and then judged wether it was a reasonable claim. But I´m not entirely sure if this should be used as criterium to evaluate an argument search machine... But else almost none of the shown arguments would really be worth something. It was more like claims to think about and develop own thoughts on it. But for this purpose those claims were useful. Not sure if that helps. Sorry ;-)"

0038,male,38.0,"I found just one argument ""pro"" illegal immigration, a couple saying that is a problem, and rather felt that the quite many shorter things were not really arguments but just claims for which maybe the surrounding context of the debate (other contributions etc.) could have shed some more light on ..."
